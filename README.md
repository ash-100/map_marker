## Features
### Map Integration:
Integrated a map view into the Flutter app and displayed a default map centered at a specific location with a zoom level that provides a clear view.

### User Interaction:
App allows users to interact with the map, including panning and zooming. The users can add and remove markers to the map by tapping on it. Each marker has a lable as well. 

### Location Information:
The app displays the latitude and longitude of the center of the map and update it as the map is panned or zoomed. The app also stores and displays information about each marker, including its latitude, longitude, and label.

### Persistent Data:
Implemented data persistence to save and retrieve marker information, so that markers are retained even when the app is closed and reopened.
